# orvPropPanelsProto - Property Panel Library 
## (An Experimental Prototype JavaScript Library)
A JavaScript Library for easily adding Property Panels to your web pages.

You have seen property panels in various IDEs. You've seen them in graphics editors like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Photo, and Affinity Designer. This library allows you to easily add a fully functional property panel to your web page.

At this point, I see that this is a prototype. A place that I am working out design issues.

At this point, it now has a dependency of:  orvCore.js for some of it's functionality.
